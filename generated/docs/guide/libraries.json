It is comparable to deciding whether a feature is a component or a service, or deciding on the scope of a component.</p>\n<p>Packaging features as a library forces the artifacts in the library to be decoupled from the application's business logic.\nThis can help to avoid various bad practices or architecture mistakes that can make it difficult to decouple and reuse code in the future.</p>\n<p>Putting code into a separate library is more complex than simply putting everything in one application.\nIt requires more of an investment in time and thought for managing, maintaining, and updating the library.\nThis complexity can pay off when the library is being used in multiple applications.</p>\n<div class=\"alert is-helpful\">\n<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: <br>\nLibraries are intended to be used by Angular applications.\nTo add Angular features to non-Angular web applications, use <a href=\"guide/elements\">Angular custom elements</a>.</p>\n</div>\n<!-- links -->\n<!-- external links -->\n<!-- end links -->\n\n  <div class=\"reviewed\">Last reviewed on Mon Feb 28 2022</div>\n</div>\n\n<!-- links to this doc:\n - guide/architecture-next-steps\n-->\n<!-- links from this doc:\n - api/forms/ReactiveFormsModule\n - guide/creating-libraries\n - guide/elements\n - guide/glossary#project\n - guide/libraries#creating-libraries\n - guide/libraries#overview-of-angular-libraries\n - guide/npm-packages\n - guide/reactive-forms\n - guide/service-worker-intro\n - guide/using-libraries\n - https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps\n - https://material.angular.io\n-->"
