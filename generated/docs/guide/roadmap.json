href=\"guide/roadmap#transition-the-angular-language-service-to-ivy\"><i class=\"material-icons\">link</i></a></h3>\n<p><em>Completed Q2 2021</em></p>\n<p>The goal of this project is to improve the experience and remove legacy dependency by transitioning the language service to Ivy.\nToday the language service still uses the View Engine compiler and type checking, even for Ivy apps.\nWe want to use the Ivy template parser and improved type checking for the Angular Language service to match app behavior.\nThis migration is also a step towards unblocking the removal of View Engine, which will simplify Angular, reduce the npm package size, and improve the maintainability of the framework.</p>\n<h3 id=\"increased-security-with-native-trusted-types-in-angular\">Increased security with native

external stylesheets is a blocking operation, which means that the browser cannot start rendering your app until it loads all the referenced CSS.\nHaving render-blocking resources in the header of a page can significantly impact its load performance, for example, its <a href=\"https://web.dev/first-contentful-paint\">first contentful paint</a>.\nTo make apps faster, we have been collaborating with the Google Chrome team on inlining critical CSS and loading the rest of the styles asynchronously.</p>\n<h3 id=\"improve-debugging-with-better-angular-error-messages\">Improve debugging with
