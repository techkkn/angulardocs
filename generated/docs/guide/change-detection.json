At a high level, Angular walks your components from top to bottom, looking for changes. Angular runs its change detection mechanism periodically so that changes to the data model are reflected in an application’s view. Change detection can be triggered either manually or through an asynchronous event (for example, a user interaction or an XMLHttpRequest completion).</p>\n<p>Change detection is highly optimized and performant, but it can still cause slowdowns if the application runs it too frequently.</p>\n<p>In this guide, you’ll learn how to control and optimize the change detection mechanism by skipping parts of your application and running change detection only when necessary.</p>\n<p>Watch this video if you prefer to learn more about performance optimizations in a media format:</p>\n<div class=\"video-container\">\n<iframe allow=\"accelerometer; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/f8sA-i6gkGQ\"></iframe>\n</div>\n\n  <div class=\"reviewed\">Last reviewed on Wed May 04 2022</div>\n</div>\n\n<!-- links to this doc:\n - guide/binding-overview\n-->\n<!-- links from this doc:\n - guide/change-detection#angular-change-detection-and-runtime-optimization\n-->"
