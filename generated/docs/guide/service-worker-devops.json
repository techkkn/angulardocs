This change causes the Angular service worker to treat the active set of files as a new version.</p>\n<div class=\"alert is-helpful\">\n<p>The build process creates the manifest file, <code>ngsw.json</code>, using information from <code>ngsw-config.json</code>.</p>\n</div>\n<p>With the versioning behavior of the Angular service worker, an application server can ensure that the Angular application always has a consistent set of files.</p>\n<h4 id=\"update-checks\">Update checks<a title=\"Link to this heading\" class=\"header-link\" aria-hidden=\"true\" href=\"guide/service-worker-devops#update-checks\"><i class=\"material-icons\">link</i></a></h4>\n<p>Every time the user opens or refreshes the application, the Angular service worker checks for updates to the application by looking for updates to the <code>ngsw.json</code> manifest.\nIf an update is found, it is downloaded and cached automatically, and is served the next time the application is loaded.</p>\n<h3 id=\"resource-integrity\">Resource integrity<a title=\"Link to this heading\" class=\"header-link\" aria-hidden=\"true\" href=\"guide/service-worker-devops#resource-integrity\"><i class=\"material-icons\">link</i></a></h3>\n<p>One of the potential side effects of long caching is inadvertently caching a resource that's not valid.\nIn a normal HTTP cache, a hard refresh or the cache expiring limits the negative effects of caching a file that's not valid.\nA service worker ignores such constraints and effectively long-caches the entire application.\nIt's important that the service worker gets the correct content, so it keeps hashes of the resources to maintain their integrity.</p>\n<h4 id=\"hashed-content\">Hashed content<a title=\"Link to this heading\" class=\"header-link\" aria-hidden=\"true\" href=\"guide/service-worker-devops#hashed-content\"><i class=\"material-icons\">link</i></a></h4>\n<p>To ensure resource integrity, the Angular service worker validates the hashes of all resources for which it has a hash.\nFor an application created with the <a href=\"cli\">Angular CLI</a>, this is everything in the <code>dist</code> directory covered by the user's <code>src/ngsw-config.json</code> configuration.</p>\n<p>If a particular file fails validation, the Angular service worker attempts to re-fetch the content using a \"cache-busting\" URL parameter to prevent browser or intermediate caching.\nIf that content also fails validation, the service worker considers the entire version of the application to not be valid and stops serving the application.\nIf necessary, the service worker enters a safe mode where requests fall back on the network. The service worker doesn't use its cache if there's a high risk of serving content that is broken, outdated, or not valid.</p>\n<p>Hash mismatches can occur for a variety of reasons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Caching layers between the origin server and the end user could serve stale content</li>\n<li>A non-atomic deployment could result in the Angular service worker having visibility of partially updated content</li>\n<li>Errors during the build process could result in updated resources without <code>ngsw.json</code> being updated.\nThe reverse could also happen resulting in an updated <code>ngsw.json</code> without updated resources.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"unhashed-content\">Unhashed content<a title=\"Link to this heading\" class=\"header-link\" aria-hidden=\"true\" href=\"guide/service-worker-devops#unhashed-content\"><i class=\"material-icons\">link</i></a></h4>\n<p>The only resources that have hashes in the <code>ngsw.json</code> manifest are resources that were present in the <code>dist</code> directory at the time the manifest was built.\nOther resources, especially those loaded from CDNs, have content that is unknown at build time or are updated more frequently than the application is deployed.</p>\n<p>If the Angular service worker does not have a hash to verify a resource is valid, it still caches its contents. At the same time, it honors the HTTP caching headers by using a policy of <em>stale while revalidate</em>.\nThe Angular service worker continues to serve a resource even after its HTTP caching headers indicate\nthat it is no longer valid. At the same time, it attempts to refresh the expired resource in the background.\nThis way, broken unhashed resources do not remain in the cache beyond their configured lifetimes.</p>\n<p><a id=\"tabs\"></a></p>\n<h3 id=\"application-tabs\">Application tabs<a title=\"Link to this heading\" class=\"header-link\" aria-hidden=\"true\" href=\"guide/service-worker-devops#application-tabs\"><i class=\"material-icons\">link</i></a></h3>\n<p>It can be problematic for an application if the version of resources it's receiving changes suddenly or without warning.\nSee the <a href=\"guide/service-worker-devops#versions\">Application versions</a> section for a description of such issues.</p>\n<p>The Angular service worker provides a guarantee: a running application continues to run the same version of the application.\nIf another instance of the application is opened in a new web browser tab, then the most current version of the application is served.\nAs a result, that new tab can be running a different version of the application than the original tab.</p>\n<div class=\"alert is-important\">\n<p><strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: <br>\nThis guarantee is <strong>stronger</strong> than that provided by the normal web deployment model.\nWithout a service worker, there is no guarantee that lazily loaded code is from the same version as the application's initial code.</p>\n</div>\n<p>The Angular service worker might change the version of a running application under error conditions such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The current version becomes non-valid due to a failed hash</li>\n<li>An unrelated error causes the service worker to enter safe mode and deactivates it temporarily</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Angular service worker cleans up application versions when no tab is using them.</p>\n<p>Other reasons the Angular service worker might change the version of a running application are normal events:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The page is reloaded/refreshed</li>\n<li>The page requests an update be immediately activated using the <code><a href=\"api/service-worker/SwUpdate\" class=\"code-anchor\">SwUpdate</a></code> service</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"service-worker-updates\">Service worker updates<a title=\"Link to this heading\" class=\"header-link\" aria-hidden=\"true\" href=\"guide/service-worker-devops#service-worker-updates\"><i class=\"material-icons\">link</i></a></h3>\n<p>The Angular service worker is a small script that runs in web browsers.\nFrom time to time, the service worker is updated with bug fixes and feature improvements.</p>\n<p>The Angular service worker is downloaded when the application is first opened and when the application is accessed after a period of inactivity.\nIf the service worker changes, it's updated in the background.</p>\n<p>Most updates to the Angular service worker are transparent to the application. The old caches are still valid and content is still served normally.\nOccasionally, a bug fix or feature in the Angular service worker might require the invalidation of old caches.\nIn this case, the service worker transparently refreshes the application from the network.</p>\n<h3 id=\"bypassing-the-service-worker\">Bypassing the service worker<a title=\"Link to this heading\" class=\"header-link\" aria-hidden=\"true\" href=\"guide/service-worker-devops#bypassing-the-service-worker\"><i class=\"material-icons\">link</i></a></h3>\n<p>In some cases, you might want to bypass the service worker entirely and let the browser handle the request.\nAn example is when you rely on a feature that is currently not supported in service workers, such as <a href=\"https://github.com/w3c/ServiceWorker/issues/1141\">reporting progress on uploaded files</a>.</p>\n<p>To bypass the service worker, set <code>ngsw-bypass</code> as a request header, or as a query parameter.\nThe value of the header or query parameter is ignored and can be empty or omitted.</p>\n<h3 id=\"service-worker-requests-when-the-server-cant-be-reached\">Service worker requests when the server can't be reached<a title=\"Link to this heading\" class=\"header-link\" aria-hidden=\"true\" href=\"guide/service-worker-devops#service-worker-requests-when-the-server-cant-be-reached\"><i class=\"material-icons\">link</i></a></h3>\n<p>The service worker processes all requests unless the <a href=\"guide/service-worker-devops#bypassing-the-service-worker\">service worker is explicitly bypassed</a>.\nThe service worker either returns a cached response or sends the request to the server, depending on the state and configuration of the cache.\nThe service worker only caches responses to non-mutating requests, such as <code>GET</code> and <code>HEAD</code>.</p>\n<p>If the service worker receives an error from the server or it doesn't receive a response, it returns an error status that indicates the result of the call.\nFor example, if the service worker doesn't receive a response, it creates a <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/504\">504 Gateway Timeout</a> status to return. The <code>504</code> status in this example could be returned because the server is offline or the client is disconnected.</p>\n<h2 id=\"debugging-the-angular-service-worker\">Debugging the Angular service worker<a title=\"Link to this heading\" class=\"header-link\" aria-hidden=\"true\" href=\"guide/service-worker-devops#debugging-the-angular-service-worker\"><i class=\"material-icons\">link</i></a></h2>\n<p>Occasionally, it might be necessary to examine the Angular service worker in a running state to investigate issues or whether it's operating as designed.\nBrowsers provide built-in tools for debugging service workers and the Angular service worker itself includes useful debugging features.</p>\n<h3 id=\"locating-and-analyzing-debugging-information\">Locating and analyzing debugging information<a title=\"Link to this heading\" class=\"header-link\" aria-hidden=\"true\" href=\"guide/service-worker-devops#locating-and-analyzing-debugging-information\"><i class=\"material-icons\">link</i></a></h3>\n<p>The Angular service worker exposes debugging information under the <code>ngsw/</code> virtual directory.\nCurrently, the single exposed URL is <code>ngsw/state</code>.\nHere is an example of this debug page's contents:</p>\n<code-example format=\"output\" hidecopy=\"\" language=\"shell\">\n\nNGSW Debug Info:\n\nDriver version: 13.3.7\nDriver state: NORMAL ((nominal))\nLatest manifest hash: eea7f5f464f90789b621170af5a569d6be077e5c\nLast update check: never\n\n=== Version eea7f5f464f90789b621170af5a569d6be077e5c ===\n\nClients: 7b79a015-69af-4d3d-9ae6-95ba90c79486, 5bc08295-aaf2-42f3-a4cc-9e4ef9100f65\n\n=== Idle Task Queue ===\nLast update tick: 1s496u\nLast update run: never\nTask queue:\n * init post-load (update, cleanup)\n\nDebug log:\n\n</code-example>\n<h4 id=\"driver-state\">Driver state<a title=\"Link to this heading\" class=\"header-link\" aria-hidden=\"true\" href=\"guide/service-worker-devops#driver-state\"><i class=\"material-icons\">link</i></a></h4>\n<p>The first line indicates the driver state:</p>\n<code-example format=\"output\" hidecopy=\"\" language=\"shell\">\n\nDriver state: NORMAL ((nominal))\n\n</code-example>\n<p><code>NORMAL</code> indicates that the service worker is operating normally and is not in a degraded state.</p>\n<p>There are two possible degraded states:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th align=\"left\">Degraded states</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Details</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\"><code>EXISTING_CLIENTS_ONLY</code></td>\n<td align=\"left\">The service worker does not have a clean copy of the latest known version of the application.
