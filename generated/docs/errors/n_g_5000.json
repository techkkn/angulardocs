This is not yet a fully supported configuration.</p>\n<p>If you use a custom Zone.js implementation, make sure that the \"onStable\" event is emitted at the right time and does not result in incorrect application behavior with hydration.</p>\n<p>More information about hydration can be found in the <a href=\"guide/hydration\">hydration guide</a>.</p>\n\n  </div>\n\n\n  \n</div>\n\n<!-- links to this doc:\n - errors\n-->\n<!-- links from this doc:\n - api/core/BootstrapOptions#ngZone\n - errors/NG5000#description\n - errors/NG5000#ng5000-hydration-was-enabled-with-unsupported-zonejs-instance\n - guide/hydration\n-->"
